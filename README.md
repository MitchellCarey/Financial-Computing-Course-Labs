This is simply a mess of files I was using during the Completion of a course - Quantitative Analysis and Portfolio construction using Python

### This is not reflective of my programming ability outside of them purely being the files I used to pass the course. They are akin to taking notes on a spare piece of paper. In real scenarios I would have structured pretty much everything in the correct manner and would have made a better use of comments. Whilst I am able to go through and connect the dots as to what is happening, it was not inteneded to be ever read by anyone else.
